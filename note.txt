1. How the Deployment Matrix Works
The matrix is the brain of your resource distribution. When you run a simulation, the system:

Scans the Grid: It analyzes 120-400 unique geographical nodes.
Identifies Hotspots: It sorts these nodes by AQI concentration from highest to lowest.
Arms Nodes: It selects the top 15 most polluted nodes (the "Nodes Armed") and prepares an intervention plan for them.
2. Is the Budget Sufficient?
The system calculates an "Ideal Budget" required to fix every hotspot at 100% capacity.

Base Cost: Each regular node ($>80$ AQI) costs $5,000 to treat.
Hazardous Premium: If a node is $>150$ AQI, the cost doubles to $10,000 because it requires heavy industrial "Smog Towers."
Sufficiency: If your allocated budget matches or exceeds this "Ideal Budget," the system considers it "Sufficient" and gives you 100% efficiency.
3. Naming Pattern: ELMT_Desc-002
ELMT: Stands for Element, representing a specific physical grid location.
Desc: Short for Descriptor, the internal ID prefix used by the logic engine.
002: The unique sequence number of the grid cell (padded to 3 digits).
Pattern: ELMT_ + Descriptor Type + 00X. This allows the system to track thousands of unique urban blocks individually.
4. What is "Nano-Mist Ops"?
The system automatically chooses the intervention based on the severity of the pollution:

Smog Tower: Deployed only in Hazardous zones (AQI $>150$). These are high-cost, high-power filtration units.
Nano-Mist Ops: Deployed in Moderate/Caution zones. This is a biophilic, soft-tech solution that uses fine particles to bind with urban pollutants, making them fall to the ground safely.
5. Budget Accordance & AQI Reduction Basis
Budget Allocation: The total budget is divided equally among the 15 armed nodes. If you have $85,000, each node gets roughly $5,666 (as seen in your screenshot's Cap_Alloc).
AQI Reduction: This is calculated based on Mitigation Power.
Mitigation Power = (Your Budget / Ideal Budget).
The "Impact Delta" (e.g., -34.1 AQI) is the real-time subtraction from the baseline pollution. Hotspots (Red zones) actually get a 20% efficiency bonus in the code to ensure they are cleaned faster.
6. Efficiency Index
This measures Capital Performance.

Calculation: 
(Allocated Resources / Slider Budget) * 100
.
If it shows 100%, it means every single dollar you allocated with the slider was successfully converted into "Armed Nodes." If it drops below 100%, it means the city wasn't polluted enough to justify your total spend!
7. Projected AQI Improvement
This is the Total Environmental ROI.

Calculation: It is the sum of every Impact_Delta from all 15 nodes.
In your image: The 459 is the combined total of points removed from the air across all active deployment zones.


Judges' Pitch Summary for the Blue Dots:
"When we toggle the Cloud Run Swarm, you see these blue agents appearing and converging on the hotspot. These aren't just decorative; they represent individual autonomous sensor nodes that scale dynamically using Google Cloud's serverless infrastructure. They provide the 'Hyper-Local' data needed to verify if our Vertex AI plan is actually working on the ground in real-time."


Judges' Pitch Summary for the Policy Sandbox:
"The Policy Sandbox is our 'Strategic Decision Engine' powered by simulated BigQuery ML. It allows city officials to test city-wide mandates—like EV-Only Zones or Carbon Taxes—before they are enforced. By clicking a policy, the system runs a mock BigQuery projection against historical urban data to show the immediate percentage reduction in the city's total Carbon Footprint."

Detailed Breakdown:
• EV-Only Zone: High-impact mobility restriction.
• Green Roof Mandate: Urban cooling and sequestration strategy.
• Carbon Tax: Financial leverage to reduce industrial emissions.
• BigQuery Projection: The 'Future Score' predicting long-term city ROI.


Judges' Pitch Summary for the Green Dots (Vertex AI):
"While the red dot represents the Problem, the green dots represent the Solution. These are precision-targeted intervention points calculated by Vertex AI. Instead of general advice, we provide actionable coordinates for Carbon Scrubbers and Green Corridors, optimized for the city's 3D topography to ensure maximum sequestration with minimum cost."


Judges' Pitch Summary for the Blue Dots (Cloud Run Swarm):
"The blue swarm represents our 'Active Response Layer.' Each dot is a serverless Cloud Run agent triggered by real-time Pub/Sub events. They provide hyper-local intelligence, moving to the pollution source to verify our AI's impact and monitor micro-spikes that fixed sensors might miss."

Code is working completely fine.
